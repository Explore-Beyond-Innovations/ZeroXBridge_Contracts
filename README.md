# ZeroXBridge Contracts

**ZeroXBridge** is a cross-chain liquidity protocol designed to enable secure asset locking on Ethereum (L1) and pegged liquidity minting on Starknet (L2) using Zero-Knowledge proofs. This repository houses the L1 and L2 smart contracts that power the core bridging functionality, xZB token economics, oracle updates, and dynamic protocol configurations.

## 🔗 L1 Contracts (`contracts/L1`)

### 🔸 `ZeroXBridgeL1.sol`
Core L1 bridge contract that:
- Accepts asset deposits from users (e.g., ERC-20 tokens)
- Records locked value and user ownership
- Emits events and Merkle-compatible data for L2 proof generation
- Verifies relayer-authenticated proofs for asset redemption

> 🔒 Uses `ElipticCurve.sol` for relayer signature verification

---

## 🧪 Tests (`contracts/L1/test`)

### 🔹 `MockERC20.sol`
Utility token used for testing deposit functionality.

### 🔹 `ZeroXBridgeL1.t.sol` & `ZeroXBridgeProofAndRelayerTest.t.sol`
Unit and integration tests verifying:
- Asset locking logic
- Event emission
- Relayer and proof verification
- Edge case handling

---

## 🌌 L2 Contracts (`contracts/L2`)

### 🔸 `ZeroXBridgeL2.cairo`
Main bridge contract on Starknet responsible for:
- Accepting zkProofs of locked L1 assets
- Minting `xZB` tokens to L2 users
- Enforcing unique proof constraints
- Burning `xZB` to trigger off-ramp redemptions

### 🔹 `xZBERC20.cairo`
Cairo-native ERC-20 implementation of the xZB token.
- Standard balance tracking and transfers
- Internal mint and burn access controlled by the bridge

### 🔹 `mint_xZB.cairo`
Wrapper contract/function for controlled minting of xZB.
- Uses access-controlled bridge to mint tokens
- Modularizes mint logic for governance upgrades

### 🔹 `L2Oracle.cairo`
Tracks time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or external price feeds.
- Fetches or stores L1-equivalent USD values for locked tokens
- Enables fair value minting of xZB

### 🔹 `Dynamicrate.cairo`
Dynamic rate controller for minting or redemption.
- Adjusts protocol-wide conversion ratios based on:
  - Supply/demand
  - Oracle input
  - DAO governance

### 🔹 `Timelock.cairo`
Timelocked governance contract.
- Enforces a delay on critical updates (e.g., oracle, mint cap)
- Protects against instant malicious changes

### 🔹 `DAO.cairo`
On-chain governance interface.
- Enables decentralized proposals and voting
- Interfaces with the timelock contract
- Allows community-driven control of bridge parameters

## 🚀 Getting Started

### L1 (Foundry)
```bash
cd contracts/L1
forge build
forge test
```

### L2 (Scarb/snfoundry)
```bash
cd contracts/L2
scarb build
snfoundry test
```

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

ZeroXBridge contracts are modular and upgrade-friendly. With security and transparency in mind:
- Proofs are required for minting
- Rates are governed dynamically via DAO
- Timelocks enforce safety for sensitive changes
- All tokens are pegged 1:1 via oracle-fed fair pricing
